				<h3 id="responsive">Responsive Web Design</h3>
				<p>Due to wide variety of devices available and that most are different screen sizes the web has changed. With the processing power these mobile devices are capable of, there really is no reason that you can't do something on a mobile device and only on a desktop.</p>

				<p>When I design or redesign a website, I prefer mobile first responsive web design. I find that if I start designing in a small screen I can fit all of the content required keeping the file size of the website small but keeping all of the necessary information in.</p>

				<h3>Future Friendly Thinking</h3>
				<p>As I design websites I keep in mind that many more devices are going to be introduced than there are currently out there right now.</p>

				<p>Future friendly thinking is about being prepared to whatâ€™s next. Keeping your content ready for the next wave of emerging devices without sacrificing quality or cutting corners.</p>

				<h3>git and github</h3>
				<p class="italic">Disclaimer: I'm new to git and github. But I can't imagine a better way to manage version control. </p>
				<p>github is a great place that keeps track of all of your commits, and a place to manage from small to large projects. </p>
				<p></p>
				<p>My github may be a bit sloppy with the commits I've chosen, or messages I give to my commits. I'm learning and will continue to use git/github for my future projects.  </p>
