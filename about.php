	<h2>About me:</h2>
	<p>I have been living in SLO County for the past 7 years. I am a family man, I enjoy being outdoors, playing board games and video games, and have always been interested in technology. </p>

	<p>I've recently become interested in web design and development. I have found web development to be a challenging and rewarding endeavor.</p>

	<p>If you would like to get in touch or work on a project together, message me and let's talk. You can find samples of my code on my <a href="https://github.com/czaas">github</a></p>
