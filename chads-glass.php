      <h2>Chad's Glass</h2>

      <p>This site reaches out to instagram for the first 20 or so posts and displays them in a grid. You can pull up the modal by clicking on one of the thumbnails. Videos have a video icon in the top right corner. </p>

      <p>As you scroll down the page you will see a loading indicator, once you see this, the page reaches out to instagram and loads the next 20 until there are no more posts from him.</p>

      <p>I decided to use <a href="https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp" target="_blank">hyperapp js</a> library which I was drawn to after looking through the github repo. It has a simple state, actions, and view management which allowed for a very smooth development. </p>
