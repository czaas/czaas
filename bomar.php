			<h2>Bomar Security Web App</h2>
			<p>This web app is an internal site that the guards for this security company use so they may send reports and check boxes and a time stamp gets sent to HQ with their geo-location data.</p>
			<p>Below you see the two view-ports. They were designed for a tablet view as that's what the guards carry around. The log in screen was basic. Once logged in you can see the pull down menu which had all of their job-sites listed which they could log on and off. In the check mark box below it would time stamp and send off the geo-location data and time that the box was checked.</p>
			<p>I focused heavily on the <span class="imp">UX</span> when I created this so the guards can spend less time looking at the screen of the device they were using and more on securing the area they were in. I made this with <span class="imp">HTML</span>, <span class="imp">Sass/CSS</span>, and <span class="imp">Javascript</span>. </p>
