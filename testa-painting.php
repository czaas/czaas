      <h2>Testa Painting</h2>
      
      <p>Below you see two view-ports, mobile and desktop. I used a mobile first approach, utilizing images provided by my client with a slider to showcase his work. Using Yelp reviews, I created cards to showcase some of his testimonials and recommendations as it is a big part of his business.</p>

      <p>I used bxslider to showcase the images and SASS for the styles as well as a simple contact form.</p>
