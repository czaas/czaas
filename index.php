				<p>For a restaurant, the mobile websites must be well laid out., most people that navigate to a restaurant want to know a few things off the bat; hours, menu, reservations, and a form of contact. I used <span class="imp">HTML</span>, <span class="imp">Sass/CSS</span>, and <span class="imp">Javascript</span> to give this restaurant a <span class="imp">responsive</span> website that the users want.</p>

				<p>I focused heavily on the <span class="imp">UX</span> when I created this so the guards can spend less time looking at the screen of the device they were using and more on securing the area they were in.
