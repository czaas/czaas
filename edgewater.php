			<h2>Edgewater Inn</h2>
			<p>With <span class="imp">UX</span> in mind, I laid out the content in a easily digestible way so that when a guest gets to the website they can do what they want to do. I created this <span class="imp">responsive</span> website with <span class="imp">HTML</span>, <span class="imp">Sass/CSS</span>, and <span class="imp">JQuery</span>.</p>
			<p>Below you see three view-ports, small, medium, and large. When making websites I use the mobile first approach and this leaves no device size out. I start with the smallest view-port, then expand and create breakpoints when necessary. </p>
